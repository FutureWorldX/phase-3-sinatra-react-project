## Project Name: Rent a Shop Shelf App

Frontend is available [here](https://github.com/FutureWorldX/Phase-3-Independent-Project)

## Description

- Small businesses involved with products such as cosmetics and clothing require temporary shelf space to store orders made by clients. However renting shop space increases overhead and storage costs which may be more than weekly sales volume.
- Also, there are companies that can manage these overheads in shopping malls & offer the service of renting shelf space. 

## Solution

Developing an app that helps the companies that are involved with renting shelf space to keep track of the small business that had made orders with them. 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The shop owner can save a customer's order when providing rented shelf space. 

## Tools:
